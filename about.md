Welcome to my pages! I'm Dawine Pierre, or just "Ben" for relatives. I have a diploma in Rural Engineering, a [Specialization in Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/SV2QST3RG45L), 12 GIS certificates from ESRI and ... - I'm a fan of checkers, data, programming, statistics, soccer, and anything for which conception is worthy...

## A little bit about my background

Born in Terrier-rouge, Haiti in 1976 to parents irresponsible, I spent all my childhood years in Cap-Haïtien with my aunt and the bulk of the rest of my professional career in Port-au-Prince.

## Teaching

I've have been at UNCNH and UPH during one year, teaching the sciences of Climatology and Technical Drawing.

## Publication

I've published a ton of documents and web applications. Among them I filtered the top six based on the length, the subject and the content value. Navigate in as quickly as you can!

## Working with and setting up start-ups

For over 6 years I've been the GIS & Database Manager at the [American Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org) and [ACTED](http://www.acted.org). I was involved in projects from their Identification and Design to Evaluation. I had a great enthousiasm in hiring staff, setting up management teams, reporting to financial boards, adjusting conduct policies - it's been an amazingly experience! 

I'm currently involved with an innovative Information System Enterprise [ECSI](http://www.ecsi-haiti.com/) that just launched in 2015, I'm the director - so far it's been hard work and great fun.


## Getting in contact

I'm at [facebook](http://facebook.com/pdawine), though admittedly I seldom fly in.  I use more frequently my [gmail account](dawin.pierre@gmail.com) and my skype name: pierre.dawine
